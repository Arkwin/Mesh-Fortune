### Installation

Create a virtual environment and install Mesh Fortune:
```bash
python3 -m venv mesh-fortune
cd mesh-fortune && source bin/activate
pip3 install meshtastic paho-mqtt cryptography
git clone https://github.com/Arkwin/Mesh-Fortune.git
cd Mesh-Fortune
```

### Running the Fortune Bot
```bash
python mqtt-connect.py
```

### Configuration

Edit `config.ini` to customize:
- **Node Settings:** Your node number, long/short name
- **MQTT Settings:** Broker, credentials, topics
- **Regional Topics:** Add multiple root topics for cross-region support  
- **Debug Options:** Enable detailed logging

Example `config.ini`:
```ini
[DEFAULT]
node_number = 2882380807
long_name = FortuneBot
short_name = FB
mqtt_broker = mqtt.meshtastic.org
root_topic = msh/US/2/e/,msh/US/DMV/2/e/,msh/US/VA/2/e/
channel = LongFast
key = AQ==
debug = true
```

### How It Works

## Mesh Fortune System

This system provides a fun fortune cookie bot for Meshtastic users across multiple regions. When someone sends a direct message to your fortune bot node, it automatically replies with a random fortune from the `fortunes.txt` file.

### Getting Your Fortune

**Getting a Fortune:**
Simply send any direct message to the fortune bot node and you'll receive a random fortune in response!

### Fortune Database

The bot reads from `fortunes.txt` which contains:
- Inspirational quotes
- Funny sayings  
- Motivational messages
- Random wisdom
- Silly observations

You can customize the fortunes by editing the `fortunes.txt` file - just put one fortune per line.

### Multi-Region Support

The fortune bot automatically works across different Meshtastic regions:
- **Supported Regions:** Configurable via `config.ini`
- **Cross-Region Delivery:** Fortunes sent across different mesh regions
- **Smart Routing:** System remembers where users were last seen for efficient delivery

### Database Storage

- Node information is cached for faster lookups
- Message history is maintained for debugging
- Automatic database setup on first run
- Lightweight SQLite database (`fortune.db`)

### Example Fortunes

Here are some examples of what the bot might send:

- "A comfort zone is a magical place where nothing ever grows."
- "Go confidently in the direction of your dreams."
- "Curiosity kills boredom. Nothing can kill curiosity."
- "Better ask twice than lose yourself once."

### Adding Your Own Fortunes

To add custom fortunes:
1. Open `fortunes.txt` in a text editor
2. Add one fortune per line
3. Save the file
